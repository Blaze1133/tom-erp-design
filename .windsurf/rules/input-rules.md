✅ Task: Interactive Task Loop with User Feedback
Check if userinput.py exists in the root directory.

   
If it doesn't exist, create it with the following content:

     
     # userinput.py
     user_input = input("prompt: ")
     


Main Workflow:

   
Perform your assigned tasks.

   
Run:

     
     python userinput.py
     

   
The terminal should be opened in the chat window itself.

   
Read the user's input.

   
Based on the input, perform the next set of tasks.

   
Repeat the process.

Exit Condition:


   
If the user enters "stop" when prompted, exit the loop and terminate the process.
